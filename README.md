# Delve: The Dice Game Online
![Delve Logo](/images/delve_logo.jpg)
This is an Elm implementation of [Delve: The Dice Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/43691/delve-dice-game)

About this game:
* You control a party of adventurers (Fighter, Rogue, Cleric and Wizard)
* In a dungeon, you will face a unique challenge in each chapter.
* Each attack round, based on dice rolls you will get a selection of attack options.
* This is a work in progress with one dungeon. The full game has 4 official dungeons.

I use Elm, because I think it is easier to debug and maintain over time. Also, the web application can easily be hosted anywhere and accessed by any browser.

To run this project:
* Install Elm
* Run "elm reactor" in the project root directory
* Navigate to src -> Main.elm in the browser

This is a work in progress. I will host an online version if the game is finished.
